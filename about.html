  <h4>Since I started as an intern at The Washington Post, I have worked on a variety of projects big and small. From the redesign of the Capital Weather Gang weather modules to leading the user experience of The Coral Project's suite of tools, I aim to make easy-to-use products which allow users to accomplish their goals.</h4>

  <p class="drop-cap Coral">I’m a Senior Digital Designer at The Washington Post. I’m especially excited about the intersection of design and online communities.</p> 

  <p>Most recently as the Lead Designer of The Coral Project, I collaborated with individuals from The New York Times, The Washington Post and Mozilla, to build tools which help readers and journalists better engage online.</p>

  <p>I oversaw the visual design and user experience of our tools at every stage of the design process from ideation to execution. Some highlights from my time on the project include learning an Agile workflow, conducting regular design thinking exercises with remote teammates all over the world and speaking on a panel at Tumblr about building better online communities. You can read more about the project here.</p> 

  <p>From my first project at The Washington Post developing styles for the 2014 midterm elections to creating a commenting experience for readers to discuss feminism in the twenty-first century, I constantly strive to elevate The Post’s award-winning journalism while prioritizing the needs of our online users.</p>

  <p>I’m always looking for ways to push myself whether it’s facilitating classes outside of work or developing recipes and shooting pictures for my food blog. As a Visual Design Teaching Assistant at General Assembly, I facilitated classes of all sizes comprised mostly of students looking to pivot their careers and join the design industry. I am a better designer because I had the opportunity to examine my own practices while encouraging students who never ceased to inspire me with their dedication and curiosity.</p> 

  <p>Above all, I value team collaboration, attention to detail, and freedom to create. Each project I’ve been a part has come together because of dedicated and passionate individuals I am proud to work alongside and learn from every day.</p>
