        <h3>I know what I need, but I don’t see it listed above. Can we still work together?</h3> 
        <p>My list of services is meant to provide a general idea of my capabilities, but the packages I offer are customized for every client’s individual needs.</p>

        <p>No matter the project, I like to start by learning more about you, your goals and design needs. Then I  create several package options. After you select which package best meets your needs, I require a 25% deposit before starting a project.</p> 

        <h3>I’m not entirely sure what I need, but I have a general idea. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Email is the best way to reach me. Send questions or just a hello to emmagrdina@gmail.com.</p>

        <p>It would be helpful for me to know any ideas you have and what your deadline might be. That’s it! Then I will reach out to you about potential next steps.</p> 

        <h3>What if my project has a quick turnaround?</h3>
        <p>Every project has a varied timeline. Some factors include but are not limited to what you need, when you need it by and what other projects I'm working on.</p>

        <p>Designing in a newsroom taught me not only how to work quickly but also prioritize ruthlessly. I aim for no surprises throughout my design process regardless of the timeline. Communication and collaboration are key to your success and happiness and mine.</p>
