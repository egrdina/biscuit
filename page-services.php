    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p class="question first">I know what I need, but I don’t see it listed above. Can we still work together?</p>
        <p>My list of services provides a general idea of my capabilities, but the packages I offer are tailored to each client’s specific needs. My expertise lies in digital product design, but my experience ranges from invitation suites and social media graphics to custom, multi-page, responsive websites.</p> 
        <p>I do my best work when I'm designing for causes I believe in which include quote unquote women's rights, making information accessible for everyone and empowering individuals with delightful, easy-to-use online experiences.</p> 

        <p class="question">I’m not entirely sure what I need, but I have a general idea. What should I do?</p>
        <p>Email me at emmagrdina@gmail.com.</p>

        <p>It would be helpful for me to know any ideas you have and what your deadline might be. That’s it! Then I will reach out to you about potential next steps.</p> 

        <p class="question">I sent you an email. Now what?</p> 
        <p>I respond to emails within 48 hours. My first step is always to learn more about you, your goals and design needs, ideally over the phone if the stars align. Phone calls give me the opportunity to get a quick sense of where you are in your own timeline and how we might collaborate.</p> 

        <p>After I learn more about you and your project, then I create several package options to provide you with a range of design assets at various price points. When you select which package best meets your needs, I require a non-refundable deposit before starting a project.</p> 

        <p class="question">What if my project has a quick turnaround?</p>
        <p>Designing in a newsroom taught me not only how to work quickly but also how to prioritize ruthlessly. Every project has a timeline tailored to its unique considerations. Some factors include but are not limited to designs you need, the deadline and my current workload.</p>

        <p>Communication and collaboration starting on day one of our working together are key to your success and happiness and mine.</p>

        <p class="question">Not sure where to start?</p>
        <p>Whether you want to spruce up an existing visual identity or you have a hunch you need a designer but don't know where to start, I offer free 15-min. UX and design consultations. During these calls we'll walk through any existing design assets you may have (website, social graphics, etc.), and I'll share where I see opportunities for improvement.</p>
        <p>Then we can decide if we want to keep the conversation going! I know design can feel overwhelming. Let me help you make sense of it all.</p>
