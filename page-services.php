    <p>I’m a firm believer that sophisticated, minimal design and striking typography lead to delightful experiences both online and IRL.</p>

    <p>Every project has its own unique set of needs, but my values set me apart as a dedicated designer, passionate communicator and empathetic human.</p>

    <h1>Values</h1>
    <ul id="one"><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i><p>Collaboration</p> 
        <p>Before I create anything, I like to learn about your goals and how you define success. Your motivations inform my design decisions and the overall strategy.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul id="two"><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i><p>Communication</p>
        <p>I believe there is a time and a place for surprises, and your project is not one of them. As a client, you will receive regular updates and have the opportunity to provide feedback throughout our time working together.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul id="three"><i class="fas fa-heart"></i><p>Intention</p>
        <p> Designs created with a purpose are not only easy to consume but they radiate energy and excitement. Audiences can tell when something has intention behind it, and I am to infuse meaning into everything I make.</p>

        <h3>I know what I need, but I don’t see it listed above. Can we still work together?</h3>
        <p>My list of services provides a general idea of my capabilities, but the packages I offer are adjusted for every client’s individual needs. I’m a digital product designer by trade, and I have experience ranging from designing invitation suites and social media graphics to custom, multi-page, responsive websites.</p> 
        <p>Whether you’re a small business who wants to spruce up their online presence or you’re launching a passion project, I’d love to work with you.</p> 

        <h3>I’m not entirely sure what I need, but I have a general idea. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Email me! You can always find me at emmagrdina@gmail.com.</p>

        <p>It would be helpful for me to know any ideas you have and what your deadline might be. That’s it! Then I will reach out to you about potential next steps.</p> 

        <h3>I sent you an email. Now what?</h3> 
        <p>I try to respond to emails within 48 hours of receiving them. My first step is always to learn more about you, your goals and design needs, ideally over the phone if the stars align. Phone calls give me the opportunity to get a quick sense of where you are in your own timeline and how we might collaborate.</p> 

        <p>After I learn more about you and your project, then I create several package options. When you select which package best meets your needs, I require a non-refundable 50% deposit before starting a project.</p> 

        <h3>What if my project has a quick turnaround?</h3>
        <p>Designing in a newsroom taught me not only how to work quickly but also how to prioritize ruthlessly. Every project has a timeline which is tailored to its unique considerations. Some factors include but are not limited to designs you need, when your deadline is and my current workload.</p>

        <p>I aim for no surprises throughout my design process regardless of the timeline. Communication and collaboration are key to your success and happiness and mine.</p>
