  <h5>THE GIST</h5>
  <h4>The Coral Project is an open-source collaboration with The Washington Post, The New York Times and Mozilla. After receiving a four million dollar grant in 2015, The Coral Project built a suite of products which allow journalists to better engage with their readers and vice versa.</h4>

  <h4>I joined the team as the Lead Designer in February 2016 and oversaw the visual design, information architecture and execution of our design team of two’s human-centered design process.</h4>

<div class="project-body">
  <p class="drop-cap Coral">Given the small size of the team, each member had the unique opportunity to dive deep and work in a variety of roles throughout planning and execution. I worked with independent researchers to conduct remote user testing and learn more about our users. Shortly after I joined the team, I also helped hire our User Experience Designer Sam. Together, she and I prioritized putting the user first at every step of the process from sketching to user testing.</p> 

  <p>Working in a remote environment with developers, a product manager, and project leads taught me the importance of over communicating and speaking up during both regular and impromptu meetings. We adopted an agile workflow which encouraged team-wide collaboration despite the hundreds of miles between us.</p> 

  <p>Agile also helped us position our design team for success since we created design ahead of development sprints. I also led bi-weekly design thinking exercises remotely in an effort to cultivate empathy for our users and challenge conventional notions about online communities.</p> 

  <p>Every team member’s belief in our mission to create better online communities helped to push our project further than we could have imagined, and I am proud to have been part of this team.</p>

  <p>Currently, I’m applying everything I learned while part of The Coral Project to our online communities at The Washington Post.</p>
